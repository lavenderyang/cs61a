# 2. Python Basics 

# Primitive expressions 
# A primitive expression requires only a single evaluation step. Literals, such as numbers and strings, evaluate to themselves. 
# Names require a single lookup step 

# Arithmetic expressions 
# Artimethic expressions in Python are very simlar to ones we've seen in other math contexts. They involve binary arithmetic operators (+,-,*,/,//,% and **) and follow PEMDAS rules

# Assignment statements
# An assignment statement assigns a certain value to a variable name. 
# To execute an assignment statement: 
# 1. Evaluate the expression on the right-hand-side of the statement to obtain a value. 
# 2. Bind the value to the name on the left-hand-side of the statement 

3 + 4 ** 2                   # 19
a = 6 + 2 * 4                # 
a                            # 14
b = (2 + 2) * 2 + 3 % 2      # 
b                            # 9
a + 2  * b                   # 32
b += a                       # 
a                            # 14
b                            # 23
